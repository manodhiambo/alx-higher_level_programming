	.Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))

	.Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the 
	author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better 
	understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. 
	Make sure you read only the following paragraphs:
	 “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” 
	“Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and 
	Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and 
	Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)

	.Class and Instance Attributes

	.classmethods and staticmethods

	.Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private 
	Attributes”)

	.str vs repr
